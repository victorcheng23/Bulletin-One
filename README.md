# BulletinOne
A React Native mobile application that displays useful information all in one screen. Users can look up the time, view the weather forecast, set reminders, and browse news articles. Created with React-Native, this application is compatible with both iOS and Android.
Data such as weather information were gathered through the use of web APIs such as OpenWeather.

# Current Functionalities
BulletinOne currently displays the time and weather. Using data from web APIs, the time and weather information will change depending on the set location.
BulletinOne by default sets the location automatically by detecting the user's location. Users can turn off automatic location to set a location manually. Users may also change the displayed temperature scale to their preferred choice.

BulletinOne was styled to have a simple and clean design. Inspired by the style of iOS 7+, this application was designed with translucent overlays, a thin typeface, and 'flat' styled gradients.
The colors for the backgrounds were chosen to reflect the colors of the sky during different times of day. The colors will change depending on the time of the set location.
